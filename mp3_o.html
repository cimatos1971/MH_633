<h1>Welcome to Iris Matos's Mini Project 3 Digital Audio Page.</h1>

<p>In order to make ths audio file, I went to a website called Bensound to find open source music that I liked. I downloaded the files to my computer and then imported them into Audacity. Once in Audacity, I recorded my voice and then used the split, time slide, mix, cut, and normalize tools to finalize my project. This is the week where things started going downhill the last time through the class, so I decided to redo the audio file to make it better.</p>
