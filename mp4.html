<p>I ran each page through the validator and came back with the same exact errors. The first 2 were to do with having the correct code for the language and I was able to fix them. Numbers 3 through 41 are a complete mystery to me. It has to do with having "style" unnecessarily for Javascript, but it doesn't show up in my code.</p>
